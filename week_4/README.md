# Week 3: Making DeFi product

As last week was quite a lot we took this this week to create a project and publish on EtherPunk.

#### 1. Using Chainlink

We learned about chainlink decentrlized oracles. Tried using Chainlink price feed.

#### 2. Building with Layer 2

Learned about Layer 2 scaling. Moving projects from Eth to Matic is very easy, we just need matic provider. Upgrading to Matic gives us advantages like low transaction fee and fast transactions.

#### 3. Metatransactions Biconomy

Explored Biconomy, created a dapp on biconomy with matic. Tested in one project.

Also explored Graph Protocol adn Covalent this week.

Finished a project named [Crypto PortFolio](https://github.com/AmanRaj1608/crypto-portfolio) submitted in [EtherPunk](https://devfolio.co/submissions/cryptoportfolio-along-with-safer-loans-1b0b)
